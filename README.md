# Project 3 - Budget App

* Group name: GO UT
* Group members: Gloria Hagin and Opeyemi Adebayo
* Project Title: Budget App


In this project we would build a budget application that would enable the end user, to manage and keep track of their daily expenses and also create a budget. The application would connect with their personal bank account or other financial institutions they so choose. The application would consist of the following features.
* Analyze/Categorize transactions
* Visualisualizations showing their current spendings.
* Create new budget with max spending alert. 
* Reminders
* Money saving resources such as coupons.

Within this project we would also provide the average household cost of living within the US (50 States)
