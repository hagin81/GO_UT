The purpose of the GO-UT Budgeting App is to help individuals and businesses visualize their spending habits and take control of their expenditures. According to an article on CNBC,  63 percent of Americans cannot cover a $500 emergency expense, due to mismanagement of resources. We have built an app to help users monitor their spendings and set a budget for their expenses. Along with the App there are resources available it to help users save, monitor their credit score and learn facts about various types of finances.

According to Bank of America, first step of budgeting is to keep a record of daily expenses, then develop a budget and save towards something. 
The best way to save is to have the 50/30/20 ratio in mind. That is, spend 50 percent of income on needful expenses, 30 percent on wants and save 20 percent. These steps keep one in alignment with personal goals. <br>
